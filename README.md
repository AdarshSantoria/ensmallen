**ensmallen** is a C++ header-only library for mathematical optimization.

The library provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective
function to optimize, and also a large set of standard and cutting-edge
optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical optimization task.
These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, small-batch techniques,
gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.

**Note**: this library is still in development, so documentation is not yet
available and the structure of the code is subject to change.  You have been
warned!
